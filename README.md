auto-reaver-pineapple
=====================

Pineapple infusion to execute reaver automatically

<b>WARNING: still alpha, not usable yet!!!</b>

#### Implemented features:
* reaver/wash bash automation script should be "usable" (read testable)
* Status view now displays Wash & Reaver status
* Environment can be configured
* Wash can now be started and stopped
* Output now shows some information on actions...
* Info view now lists found access points
* Reaver is now executed (started and stopped)
* Can specify custom target
* Output shows logs of last execution of reaver and wash

#### Being worked on:
* implement basic interface features
  * implement results and whitelist for auto mode
  * implement auto mode

#### TODO:
* change actions to async js calls? =/
* change reaver & wash stats to async js calls?
* change log view to async js calls? (would not need to reload index.php)
* the less js the better...

#### FUTURE:
* be able to use multiple (read.. two) interfaces? Would need to rewrite the whole thing...
